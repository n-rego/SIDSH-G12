## Project Description
With this project SIDSH intends to adopt a software development discipline for the company (group) to
build software in a way that it can be released to production at any time.
In other words, the company wants:
- Software to be deployable throughout its lifecycle;
- Teams to prioritize keeping the software deployable over working on new features;
- Anybody can get fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of the software
products, any time somebody makes a change to them;
- Perform push button deployments of any version of the software, to any customer
environment, on demand. 

SIDSH has to automate the full software production pipeline, including the build process, testing,
releases, configuration changes, etc.

Software configuration and versions management must be used to control everything, including code
configuration, scripts, documentation, etc.

The company adopts the software production principle of ‘Done’ means released, i.e., a feature is done
only when it is in production.
